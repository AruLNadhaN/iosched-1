Droidcon UK 2013 customised IOSched
===================================

* If you want to hack some coding please co-ordinate with Al Sutton
(@alsutton on Twitter) to ensure you're not duplicating work *

This is a work in progress, things means things may not work. Much of the
current work is focused on removing the dependancy on Googles APIs which
may not be available to the non-Google apps (e.g. the developers.google.com
endpoints for syncing).

Feel free to fork and push.....
