Yet new apps launch every day, and monster successes from Rovio, Supercell and King.com give developers and coders hope that they could have the next global smash hit.\r\n\r\nThe reality is far less glamorous. As this presentation will seek to show, launching an app requires a blend of skills and a keen business brain if an app is to have a chance of success.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will share a wealth of best practice, tips and tricks, data and insight into how to create and launch apps. It will also explain why the marketing of your app only starts with the launch, and why you need to be thinking long-term about keeping your app fresh and your users engaged if you are going to get them spending money. The presentation will cover the key issues around mobile game marketing and discovery, talk about successes and failures in app marketing, and discuss how indie developers can work smarter in an effort to compete with the big-spending publishers that often dominate the app stores.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382604300,"webLink":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/sessions/top-10-tips-for-marketing-your-mobile-games/","presenterIds":["110"],"endTimestamp":1382606700},{"id":"121","title":"Authentication for Droids","location":"6","description":"This talk is going to shed some light on different techniques that help to authenticate users in your service via methods such as Basic Authentication and more advanced technologies like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

However, thanks to its very open nature (and the NDK), Android as a platform grants to the developers the ability to implement custom frameworks, the same way Android framework is built as a wrapper around low-level native components (skia, OpenMAX, \u2026). From extending BitmapFactory for advanced image decoding and processing (face detection, dominant colour detection, seam carving, \u2026) for Flickr to implementing a purely native highly efficient event based HTTP/HTTPS/SPDY network stack, we will demonstrate how native development has been used in Yahoo\u2019s Android products to push limits of the framework in a cross-platform, highly performant way, and solve fragmentation by providing a strictly consistent set of features across all API levels.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382607000,"webLink":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/sessions/beyond-the-framework-portable-and-efficient-system-components-using-ndk/","presenterIds":["228"],"endTimestamp":1382609400},{"id":"123","title":"Developing i\u2019m Watch Apps","location":"5","description":"Wearable computing is turning out to be the next big thing.

That is if they can get a data connection.\r\n\r\nMobile connectivity is notoriously poor in football stadia due to their construction and the high density of users. Yet, football fans increasingly expect the same level of connectivity and access to services that they experience elsewhere. Our proposed solution \u2013 sharing content and data connections betweens fans\u2019 smartphones using a delay tolerant network (DTN) implemented on Android smartphones with WiFi-Direct.\r\n\r\nIn association with Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club, we have designed and deployed an Android application to allow users\u2019 smartphones to form networks that are used to share and request content, such as live scores and Twitter. Users without mobile network connectivity were able to continue using services via the DTN, whilst those with an Internet connection were able to download and share content with others.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, the primary focus of this talk will be on the design and implementation of the DTN, the many technical issues that we had to overcome (particularly with Wifi-Direct and device dependent issues), and the practical issues of deploying a WiFi-Direct based application in the real world.\r\n\r\nProject Website: http://www.digitalstadium.mobi/","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382716800,"webLink":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/sessions/delay-tolerant-networking-using-wifi-direct/","presenterIds":["75"],"endTimestamp":1382719500},{"id":"158","title":"Hackathon","location":"7","description":"Join us at Skills Matter straight after the conference for a big weekend of Hackathon and Workshops!\r\n\r\nMini-challenges will also be organised and many prizes will be distributed by our generous sponsors \u2013 so don\u2019t miss it!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382770800,"webLink":"http://maps.google.co.uk/?daddr=Skills+Matter,+116-120+Goswell+Rd,+London+EC1V+7DP,+United+Kingdom","presenterIds":[],"endTimestamp":1382814000},{"id":"161","title":"Hackathon","location":"7","description":"Join us at Skills Matter straight after the conference for a big weekend of Hackathon and Workshops!\r\n\r\nMini-challenges will also be organised and many prizes will be distributed by our generous sponsors \u2013 so don\u2019t miss it!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382860800,"webLink":"http://maps.google.co.uk/?daddr=Skills+Matter,+116-120+Goswell+Rd,+London+EC1V+7DP,+United+Kingdom","presenterIds":[],"endTimestamp":1382904000}]}
